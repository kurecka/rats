# Risk-Aware Tree Search
This repository contains code base for development and testing of risk-aware tree search based methods.

## Usage: help
Build and run `./rats --help`.

## Rollout method
Currently only rollout method is constant zeros.

## Algorithms
- randomized: Play random action
- c0: Play action 0 constantly
- c1: Play action 1 constantly
- ts: Simple tree search. Tries to achieve the threshold at each state.
- pts: Pareto tree search. OUT OF ORDER
- dts: Dual tree search. Implements the dual algorithm CC-POMCP.
  - Does not match the decribed algorithm perfectyl. In particular, it does not use LP, just thresholding to select best greedy action.

## Todo
- [x] Pytorch binding
- [ ] Ray distributed computing
- [ ] Evironment management
- [ ] Experiment configuration files
- [ ] Mongo reporting

## Building

Make sure to have `cmake` installed

``` bash
> cd build
> cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Coverage | Release]
> make
> ./rats_app ...
> make test      # Makes and runs the tests.
> make coverage  # Generate a coverage report.
> make doc       # Generate html documentation.
```

In order to build and install as a python package, run the following commands:
```bash
> pip install .
```
The command above will build the code using cmake and install the package in the current environment as `rats` package.

## Install pytjon packages
We use `conda` to maintain python packages. Make sure you have it installed.
The environment is described in `conda_env.yaml`.

To create new environment according to the env file use:
```bash
conda env create -f conda_env.yaml
```

To activate the environment use:
```bash
conda activate rats
```

To update your environment according to the env file use:
```bash
conda env update -f conda_env.yaml
```

To export the description of your current conda environment use:
```bash
conda env export > conda_env.yml
```
